### Welcome to my github personal homepage ðŸ‘‹
ðŸ˜„ I am currently studying for a master's degree at Zhejiang University. My main research direction is visual-inertial SLAM and real-time three-dimensional reconstruction. I have little interesting personal projects, such as Zhihuijunâ€™s automatic bicycle project and the handwritten stero visual odometry project.

### Welcome to my github personal homepage 👋
- 😄 I am studying for a master's degree at Zhejiang University. My main research direction is visual-inertial SLAM and real-time three-dimensional reconstruction. I have little interesting personal projects, such as Zhihuijun’s automatic bicycle project and the handwritten stero visual odometry project. Good luck to everyone.

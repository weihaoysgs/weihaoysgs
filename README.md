- ðŸ˜„ I am studying for a master's degree at Zhejiang University. My main research direction is visual-inertial SLAM and real-time three-dimensional reconstruction, also have ðŸ‘¯ SDR(sing,dance and rap). I have a little interesting personal projects, such as [Zhihuijunâ€™s automatic bicycle](https://github.com/weihaoysgs/bike-xuan) project and the handwritten [stero visual odometry](https://github.com/weihaoysgs/ssvio) project. You can also see the effects of these interesting projects in [bilibili](https://space.bilibili.com/480920640?spm_id_from=333.1007.0.0), Good luck to everyone.
